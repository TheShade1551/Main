### 3. Write a Short note on Constraint Satisfaction Problem with Graph Coloring.
1. **Introduction to CSP**:
   - A Constraint Satisfaction Problem involves finding a solution to a problem where certain constraints must be satisfied.
   - It consists of a set of variables, each with a domain of possible values, and a set of constraints that restrict the possible combinations of values for these variables.

2. **Graph Coloring**:
   - In the Graph Coloring problem, the goal is to color the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color.
   - Formally, given a graph \( G = (V, E) \), where \( V \) is the set of vertices and \( E \) is the set of edges, the objective is to assign colors from a set \( C \) to each vertex such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color.

3. **Representation**:
   - Variables: Each vertex in the graph represents a variable in the CSP.
   - Domain: The domain of each variable represents the set of available colors that can be assigned to that vertex.
   - Constraints: Constraints are defined by the edges in the graph. For each edge connecting vertices \( v_i \) and \( v_j \), there is a constraint that the colors assigned to \( v_i \) and \( v_j \) must be different.

   ![alt text](image.png)

4. **Solving the CSP**:
   - CSPs can be solved using various techniques such as backtracking, constraint propagation, and local search algorithms.
   - Backtracking: Involves recursively trying different assignments for each variable and backtracking when a constraint is violated.
   - Constraint Propagation: Involves reducing the domain of variables based on the constraints, which helps in pruning the search space.
   - Local Search Algorithms: Such as simulated annealing or genetic algorithms can be used to find approximate solutions.

5. **Applications**:
   - Graph Coloring has applications in various fields such as scheduling, register allocation in compilers, frequency assignment in wireless communication, and timetable scheduling.
   - CSPs, in general, are used in many real-world problems like scheduling, resource allocation, planning, and configuration.

6. **Challenges**:
   - Graph Coloring is an NP-complete problem, meaning that it is computationally expensive to find an optimal solution for large graphs.
   - Efficient algorithms and heuristics are required to solve large instances of the problem within a reasonable amount of time.

In summary, Constraint Satisfaction Problems with Graph Coloring involve assigning colors to vertices in a graph such that no two adjacent vertices have the same color, and various techniques can be employed to find solutions efficiently.

## Section 3: **10 Marks Questions:**
### 1. Consider the following graph. The number on edges represent the distance the distance between the nodes. The numbers writeen on nodes represents the heuristic value. Find the most cost-effective path to reach from start state 0 to final state 1 using A* search Algotrithm. Analyze time and space complexity of A* Search Algorithm. (Note: Stepwise representation is mandatory)
  ![alt text](IMG-20240530-WA0001.jpg)

  ![alt text](image1.jpg)

A* Search Algorithm

The A* search algorithm combines features of both uniform-cost search and greedy best-first search by using the function \( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \), where:
- \( g(n) \) is the cost from the start node to node \( n \).
- \( h(n) \) is the heuristic estimate from node \( n \) to the goal.

Analysis of A* Search Algorithm

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of A* search depends on the heuristic. In the worst case, A* can be exponential in the depth of the search space, but with an admissible heuristic, it often performs much better than other algorithms like breadth-first search.
  - Worst-case time complexity: \( O(b^d) \), where \( b \) is the branching factor and \( d \) is the depth of the solution.
  
- **Space Complexity**: A* search maintains all generated nodes in memory, which can be substantial.
  - Worst-case space complexity: \( O(b^d) \).

By using the heuristic values effectively, A* search efficiently narrows down the path to the goal, often resulting in significant savings in both time and space compared to uninformed search methods.
