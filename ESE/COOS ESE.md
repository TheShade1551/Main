### 3. Types of Registers
**Registers in Computer Architecture:**

In computer architecture, registers serve as extremely fast memory units designed to efficiently execute programs and operations. They provide swift access to frequently used values, crucial for executing operations at the point of operation/execution. Various classes of CPU registers collaborate with computer memory to enhance operational efficiency.

**Types of CPU Registers:**

1. **Accumulator:**
   - *Function:* Most frequently used register for storing data from memory.
   - *Variation:* Number varies across microprocessors.

2. **Memory Address Registers (MAR):**
   - *Function:* Holds the address of the location to be accessed from memory.
   - *Interaction:* Works in tandem with Memory Data Register (MDR) for CPU-main memory communication.

3. **Memory Data Registers (MDR):**
   - *Function:* Contains data to be written into or read out from the addressed location.

4. **General Purpose Registers (GPR):**
   - *Representation:* Numbered as R0, R1, R2, ..., Rn-1.
   - *Usage:* Stores temporary data during ongoing operations.
   - *Advantage:* Allows register-to-register addressing, faster than other addressing modes.

5. **Program Counter (PC):**
   - *Function:* Tracks the execution of the program, storing the memory address of the next instruction to be fetched.
   - *Incrementation:* Depends on the architecture; in a 32-bit architecture, the PC is incremented by 4 for each instruction fetch.

6. **Instruction Register (IR):**
   - *Function:* Holds the instruction that is about to be executed.
   - *Execution:* As soon as the instruction is placed in IR, the CPU begins execution, and the PC points to the next instruction.

7. **Condition Code Register (CCR):**
   - *Function:* Contains flags indicating the status of operations.
   - *Flags Include:*
      - **Carry (C):** Set to 1 if an add operation produces a carry or a subtract operation produces a borrow; cleared to 0 otherwise.
      - **Overflow (V):** Relevant for operations on signed integers.
      - **Zero (Z):** Set to 1 if the result is 0, cleared to 0 otherwise.
      - **Negate (N):** Significant in signed number operations, set to 1 if a negative result is produced.
      - **Extend (X):** Acts as a carry for multiple precision arithmetic operations.
   - *Decision:* Typically determined by the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).

These registers operate for specific purposes, collectively facilitating efficient program execution by managing data, memory addresses, and control flow within the CPU.

### 4. Explain Ripple Carry Adder
**Introdution**
- Structure involves cascading multiple full adders.
- Designed for addition of n-bit binary sequences.
- Utilizes a ripple carry mechanism.
- Each full adder stage generates a carry.
- Carry is forwarded to the next full adder stage.
- Process continues sequentially to the last full adder.
- Named "Ripple Carry Adder" due to sequential ripple effect of carry propagation.

**N-bit Ripple Carry Adders**
- In ripple carry adders, the two bits to be added in each adder block are instantly available.
- However, each adder block waits for the carry to arrive from its preceding block.
- Consequently, it is impossible to generate the sum and carry of any block until the input carry is known.
- The i-th block has to wait for the (i-1)-th block to produce its carry, leading to a significant time delay.
- This delay is termed carry propagation delay in the operation of ripple carry adders.

## 10 Marks:

### 1. Half & Full Adder
**Half Adder:**
- Fundamental building block for more complex adder circuits.
- Performs binary addition of single-bit inputs A and B.
- Outputs SUM (XOR of A and B) and CARRY (AND of A and B).
- SUM is the least significant bit (LSB), indicating addition result.
- CARRY is the most significant bit (MSB), showing carry-over from addition.

**Half Adder (HA):**
- Simplest of all adder circuits, adds two numbers producing sum (s) and carry (c).
- Input variables: augend (A) and addend (B) bits.
- Output variables: sum (s) and carry (c).
- Logical expressions:
  - Sum (s) = A XOR B
  - Carry (c) = A AND B
- Implementation requires one XOR gate and one AND gate.

**Truth Table:**

# Module 2: Computer Organization And Design

## 2 Marks:

### 1. Give Instrcution Formats(0,1,2-Address Instructions)
**Zero Address Instructions:**
- These instructions don't specify operands or addresses explicitly.
- Operate on data stored in registers or implicitly defined memory locations.
  - Examples: Push, Pop, Peek, Break, etc.
  - `PUSH A` implies `TOP = A`.
  - `PUSH B` implies `TOP = B`.
  - `ADD` implies `TOP = A + B`.

**One Address Instructions:**
- Specify one operand or address, often a memory location or register.
- Operate on the contents of the specified operand, and the result may be stored in the same or a different location.
  - Examples:
    - `LOAD A` implies `AC = M[A]`.
    - `ADD B` implies `AC = AC + M[B]`.
    - `STORE T` implies `M[T] = AC`.

**Two Address Instructions:**
- Specify two operands or addresses, which can be memory locations or registers.
- Operate on the contents of both operands, and the result may be stored in the same or a different location.
  - Examples:
    - `MOV R1, A` implies `R1 = M[A]`.
    - `ADD R1, B` implies `R1 = R1 + M[B]`.

### 2. Explain General Register-Based CPU Organization.
- **General Register-Based CPU Organization:**
  - Utilizes multiple general-purpose registers in CPU design, as opposed to a single accumulator register.
  - Employs two or three address fields in instruction formats, specifying general registers or memory locations.
  - Enables efficient execution by reducing memory references, speeding up program execution, and minimizing program size.
  - Example: `MULT R1, R2, R3` represents the multiplication operation `R1 <-- R2 * R3`.
  - Prominent examples of this organization include IBM 360 and PDP-11.

- **Features of General Register-Based CPU Organization:**
  - **Registers:** CPU houses a set of general-purpose registers for storing data during processing.
  - **Operand Access:** Directly accesses operands from registers, improving performance compared to memory access.
  - **Data Processing:** Performs arithmetic and logical operations directly on register-stored data, eliminating frequent data transfers.
  - **Instruction Format:** Uses an instruction format specifying operands by register numbers, rather than memory addresses.
  - **Context Switching:** Involves saving and restoring register contents during context switching to enable multiple processes to share the CPU.

### 3. Define Instruction Code.
**Instruction Codes in Computer Architecture:**
- **Definition:** Instruction codes consist of bits that direct the computer to execute a specific operation.
  
- **Components of an Instruction:**
  - **Operation Code (Opcode) Field:** Determines the specific process or operation to be performed.
  - **Address Field:** Contains the location of the operand, whether in a register or memory location.
  - **Mode Field:** Specifies how the operand is located or accessed.

This division into fields allows instructions to effectively convey the operation to be executed, the location of the operand, and the mode of accessing that operand.
![Alt text](image-17.png)

### 4. Define Addressing Modes.
**Addressing Modes in Computer Architecture:**
- **Definition:** Addressing modes represent how memory addresses for instructions are specified. 

- **Common Addressing Modes:**
  - **Direct Addressing:** Utilizes the address of the operand directly.
  - **Indirect Addressing:** Treats the address as a pointer to the operand.
  - **Immediate Operand:** The second part of the instruction code directly specifies the operand.

Understanding these addressing modes is crucial in determining how instructions interact with memory and operands during program execution.

### 5. Register Stack & Memory Stack.
**Register Stack:**

- A register stack is a type of stack that utilizes registers within the CPU for storing and retrieving data.
- Registers are small, high-speed memory locations that are integral to the CPU architecture.
- In a register stack, a set of registers is organized in a stack-like structure, and operations involving pushing and popping data are carried out directly on these registers.

**Memory Stack:**

- A memory stack, on the other hand, involves the use of the main memory to implement a stack.
- The stack is a region in the computer's memory allocated for the purpose of managing data storage and retrieval in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner.
- The stack pointer keeps track of the top of the stack, and operations like push and pop involve reading from or writing to the main memory.

**Differences:**

| Criteria               | Register Stack                                           | Memory Stack                                             |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Location**           | Utilizes registers within the CPU.                        | Utilizes the main memory of the computer.                 |
| **Speed**              | Faster access due to the proximity of registers.          | Slower access compared to registers.                       |
| **Capacity**           | Limited capacity as it depends on the number of registers.| Larger capacity as it depends on the size of the main memory.|
| **Operation Efficiency**| Generally faster for operations involving registers.      | May experience slower performance due to memory access delays.|
| **Use Cases**          | Ideal for quick and frequent data manipulations.          | Suited for managing larger datasets and function calls.    |

Both register stacks and memory stacks play essential roles in computer architecture, with each being suitable for specific scenarios based on the nature of operations and the amount of data involved.

### 6. Auto Increment & Auto Decrement

**Auto-Indexed (Increment Mode):**
- Effective address is determined by the contents of a register specified in the instruction `(R1)+`.
- After accessing the operand, the register contents are automatically incremented to the next memory location.
- Example:
  ```
  Add R1, (R2)+
  R1 = R1 + M[R2]
  R2 = R2 + d
  ```
- One register reference, one memory reference, and one ALU operation are required.

**Auto-Indexed (Decrement Mode):**
- Effective address is determined by the contents of a register specified in the instruction `–(R1)`.
- Before accessing the operand, the register contents are automatically decremented to the previous memory location.
- Example:
  ```
  Add R1, -(R2)
  R2 = R2 - d
  R1 = R1 + M[R2]
  ```
- One register reference, one memory reference, and one ALU operation are required.
- Functionally equivalent to the increment mode, useful for accessing elements in reverse order.
- Beneficial for implementing "Last-In-First-Out" (LIFO) data structures, such as stacks.

### 3. Explain Register Stack in Detail

**Register Stack**

A register stack is a storage structure in computer architecture that employs a stack-like arrangement of memory words or registers. Here, we consider a 64-word register stack as depicted in the diagram. The stack utilizes a stack pointer register to store the binary address of the element at the top of the stack. Let's delve into the key operations of the register stack:

![Alt text](image-20.png)

1. **Stack Initialization:**
   - Initially, the stack pointer (SP) is set to 0, indicating the bottom of the stack.
   - An 'EMPTY' flag is set to 1, signifying that the stack is empty.
   - A 'FULL' flag is set to 0, denoting that the stack is not yet full.

2. **Push Operation (Insertion):**
   - To insert a new element, the stack pointer is incremented (SP ← SP + 1).
   - The new element is written to the memory word at the updated stack pointer location (K[SP] ← DR).
   - If the stack is full (SP = 0), the 'FULL' flag is set to 1.
   - The 'EMPTY' flag is set to 0 to indicate that the stack is no longer empty.

3. **Pop Operation (Removal):**
   - To remove the top element, the element at the current stack pointer is read into the data register (DR ← K[SP]).
   - The stack pointer is decremented (SP ← SP - 1).
   - If the stack is empty (SP = 0), the 'EMPTY' flag is set to 1.
   - The 'FULL' flag is set to 0, indicating that the stack is not full.

4. **Handling Stack Limits:**
   - The stack pointer has 6 bits to represent addresses (111111 in binary), ensuring it stays within the stack's bounds.
   - The 'FULL' flag is set to 1 when the stack is full.
   - The binary information in or out of the stack is stored in the data register (DR).

- This register stack structure allows for efficient management of data, with the stack pointer facilitating dynamic adjustments as elements are pushed onto or popped off the stack. The 'EMPTY' and 'FULL' flags provide status indicators for effective stack utilization.

### 4. Direct Addressing Mode vs Indirect Addressing Mode

**Addressing Modes: Direct vs. Indirect**

1. **Direct Addressing Mode:**
   - **Definition:** In direct addressing mode, the instruction's address field directly contains the effective address of the operand. No intermediate memory access is needed.
   - **Example:** `Add R1, (1001)` adds the content of register R1 to the value stored at memory location 1001.
   - **Characteristics:**
     - Fast addressing with only one memory reference.
     - No further calculation is required for the operation.
     - Occupies a smaller address space.
     - Minimal overhead in operand retrieval.
     - Commonly used for accessing static data and using variables.

2. **Indirect Addressing Mode:**
   - **Definition:** In indirect addressing mode, the address field in the instruction contains the memory location or register where the effective address of the operand is stored. It involves two memory accesses.
   - **Example:** `LOAD R1, @500` loads the content of the memory location stored at memory location 500 into register R1.
   - **Characteristics:**
     - Slower addressing due to two memory references.
     - Requires further calculation to find the effective address.
     - Occupies a larger address space than direct mode.
     - Additional overhead in operand retrieval.
     - Useful for passing arrays as parameters and implementing pointers.

### 7. Explain Program Control Instructions
**Introduction:**

- Program Control Instructions are essential machine code commands used by machines or assembly language users to direct the processor's actions.
- These instructions, utilized in assembly language, get translated into machine code when executed.
- Program Control Instructions include various types, each serving distinct purposes.

**Types of Program Control Instructions:**

1. **Compare Instruction:**
   - **Description:** Similar to a subtract instruction, compares values without storing the result. Flags are set based on the comparison.
   - **Example:** `CMP R1, R2`

2. **Unconditional Branch Instruction:**
   - **Description:** Causes an unconditional change in the execution sequence to a specified location.
   - **Examples:** 
     - `JUMP L2`
     - `Mov R3, R1 ; goto L2`

   - **Description:** Examines values in the condition code register to determine a condition and branches accordingly.
   - **Example:** 
     - Assembly Code: `BE R1, R2, L1`
     - High-Level Code: `if (x==y) goto L1;`

4. **Subroutines:**
   - **Description:** Program fragments in user space that perform a specific task. Invoked by other programs and return control upon completion.

---

### 8. Base Register Addressing Mode:
**Base Register Addressing Mode:**

Base Register Addressing Mode is a memory addressing technique employed in computer architecture to calculate the effective address of operands in instructions. It involves the utilization of a base register, a special register that holds a base address, to perform memory addressing.

**Key Characteristics:**

1. **Effective Address Calculation:**
   - The effective address (EA) of the operand is determined by adding the content of a designated base register to the addressing field value specified in the instruction.
     - \(EA = \text{{Base Register}} + \text{{Address field value}}\)

2. **Base Register Selection:**
   - A particular register must be selected from the register set based on the instruction. The content of this selected base register serves as the reference point for addressing.

3. **Bit Efficiency:**
   - Base Register Addressing Mode is more bit-efficient compared to some other addressing modes, such as PC Relative Addressing. It requires fewer bits to specify a register from the register set.

4. **Displacement Concept:**
   - The addressing field in the instruction provides a displacement value relative to the base address stored in the base register. This displacement guides the effective address calculation.

5. **Increment After Fetching:**
   - In this mode, the base register does not immediately increment to the next instruction after fetching the address. The displacement value can be the same as the value required to reference the desired address.

6. **Assembler's Role:**
   - When programming in Base Register Addressing Mode, it is the responsibility of the programmer to specify the appropriate base register in the instruction. The assembler does not have prior knowledge of the base register's value.

**Example:**
```assembly
LOAD R1, 500(R2)
```
In this example, the content of register R2 is used as the base address, and the effective address is calculated by adding the displacement value 500 to the content of R2.

Base Register Addressing Mode is particularly useful when dealing with data structures or arrays where a fixed base address is employed, and elements are accessed through displacements.

### 10. Address Bus

**Address Bus:**

The address bus is a critical component of a computer's architecture, responsible for managing memory addressing. It serves as a communication pathway between the central processing unit (CPU) and memory modules, facilitating the transmission of memory addresses from the CPU to the memory subsystem. Here are key characteristics and functions of the address bus:

1. **Memory Address Handling:**
   - The address bus specifically handles memory addressing, providing a dedicated pathway for the CPU to communicate with the memory units.

2. **Memory Address Transmission:**
   - It carries memory addresses generated by the CPU to the connected memory modules. These addresses point to specific locations in the computer's memory hierarchy.

3. **Targeted Path for Memory Access:**
   - The address bus functions as a targeted path for memory access, allowing the CPU to specify which memory location it intends to read from or write to.

4. **Unidirectional Nature:**
   - Typically, the address bus is a unidirectional bus, transmitting memory addresses from the CPU to the memory modules. This one-way communication ensures a clear direction for address transmission.

5. **Memory Location Specification:**
   - It enables the CPU to specify precise memory locations by sending the corresponding memory address over the address bus. This is crucial for data retrieval and storage operations.

6. **Determining Maximum Addressable Memory:**
   - The width of the address bus determines the maximum memory capacity that can be addressed by the computer system. A wider address bus allows for a larger address space and, consequently, a greater memory capacity.

7. **Connectivity for Data Access:**
   - The address bus establishes a vital connection between the CPU and memory modules, providing the necessary infrastructure for the CPU to access data stored in different memory locations.

In summary, the address bus plays a pivotal role in facilitating memory access by providing a dedicated channel for transmitting memory addresses from the CPU to the memory modules. Its characteristics, such as unidirectionality and address width, significantly impact the overall memory capacity and efficiency of a computer system.

### 13. Memory Stack Organization
**Memory Stack and Reverse Polish Notation (Postfix Expression)**

**Memory Stack Implementation:**

A memory stack is commonly implemented in a computer's Random Access Memory (RAM). Within the CPU, a stack operation allocates a specific portion of memory, and a processor register serves as the stack pointer. This register indicates the initial memory address of the stack.

**Reverse Polish Notation (Postfix Expression) and Stack Usage:**

Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), also known as postfix expression, utilizes a stack to solve mathematical expressions. In RPN, operands are pushed onto the stack, and when an operator is encountered, elements are popped from the stack. The operator is then applied in the correct sequence, and the result is pushed back onto the stack.

![Alt text](image-22.png)

**Example:**

Consider the postfix expression: ["18", "5", "*", "6", "/"]

The corresponding infix expression is ((18 * 5) / 6), which equals 15.

**Algorithmic Approach:**

1. Iterate through each element in the array.
2. If the element is an operand, push it onto the stack.
3. If the element is an operator, pop the top two elements from the stack, perform the operation, and push the result back onto the stack.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 for each array element.
5. Pop the final result from the stack as the output.
