### 1. Differentiate tree and graph in data structures.

| **Aspect**       | **Tree**                           | **Graph**                                     |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**  | - Hierarchical structure           | - Collection of nodes and edges              |
| **Root Node**    | - Single root node                 | - No specific root node                        |
| **Cycles**       | - No cycles                        | - Cycles are possible                         |
| **Relationships**| - Reflects hierarchical relationships| - Represents complex relationships            |

### 2. Explain the balancing factor of an AVL tree.

- The **balancing factor** of an AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) tree is a numerical value that represents the height difference between the left and right subtrees of a node.
- It is defined as the height of the left subtree minus the height of the right subtree.
- In an AVL tree, the balancing factor of every node must be -1, 0, or 1.
- If the balancing factor of any node is less than -1 or greater than 1, rotations are performed to balance the tree, ensuring that it remains height-balanced.

### 3. Define binary tree and its types.

A **binary tree** is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Binary trees can be classified into several types, including:

1. **Full Binary Tree:** A binary tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.
2. **Complete Binary Tree:** A binary tree in which all levels except possibly the last are completely filled, and all nodes are as left as possible.
3. **Perfect Binary Tree:** A binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
4. **Balanced Binary Tree:** A binary tree in which the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one.

### 4. Describe the primary operation that can be performed on a binary tree.

The primary operation that can be performed on a **binary tree** is **traversal**. Tree traversal involves visiting all the nodes of the tree and performing an operation (such as printing the node value) at each node. There are three common types of tree traversal techniques:

1. **In-order Traversal:** Traverse the left subtree, visit the root node, and then traverse the right subtree.
2. **Pre-order Traversal:** Visit the root node, traverse the left subtree, and then traverse the right subtree.
3. **Post-order Traversal:** Traverse the left subtree, traverse the right subtree, and then visit the root node.

### 5. Define the term "Graph" in data structures.

- A **graph** is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes.
- Graphs are used to represent relationships between various objects.
- In a graph, nodes represent entities, and edges represent relationships or connections between entities.
- Graphs can be categorized as directed (edges have a direction) or undirected (edges have no direction).
- Graphs may also have cycles, which are sequences of edges that form loops.

### 6. Explain the concept of tree traversing techniques.

Tree traversing techniques refer to the methods used to visit all the nodes in a tree data structure. The three common tree traversing techniques are:

1. **In-order Traversal:** Traverse the left subtree, visit the current node, and then traverse the right subtree.
2. **Pre-order Traversal:** Visit the current node, traverse the left subtree, and then traverse the right subtree.
3. **Post-order Traversal:** Traverse the left subtree, traverse the right subtree, and then visit the current node.

These techniques are used to process the nodes of a tree in a specific order, allowing various operations to be performed on the tree nodes.

### 7. Differentiate between a binary tree and a binary search tree (BST).

| **Aspect**        | **Binary Tree**               | **Binary Search Tree (BST)**                |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Children**      | - At most two children       | - Left and right children                   |
| **Arrangement**   | - No specific arrangement    | - Ordered based on node values              |
| **Search/Insertion/Deletion** | - Less efficient   | - Efficient due to value-based ordering    |

## 5 Marks: 
### 1. Explain the different types of graph representation techniques.

There are two primary techniques for representing graphs:
  - **Adjacency Matrix:** In this technique, a 2D matrix represents the graph.
    - Rows and columns of the matrix correspond to the vertices of the graph.
    - A cell in the matrix indicates the presence or absence of an edge between vertices.
    - If there's an edge between vertex i and vertex j, cell (i, j) contains a 1 or the edge's weight.
    - If no edge exists, it contains 0.
    - Efficient for dense graphs but memory-intensive for sparse graphs.
  - **Adjacency List:** In this technique, each vertex maintains a list of its adjacent vertices.
    - The graph is represented as a collection of lists, one per vertex.
    - Each list contains the vertices connected to the corresponding vertex.
    - Memory-efficient for sparse graphs and commonly used for graph algorithms.

### 2. What is a Tree Data Structure? Explain the Tree representation techniques with a suitable example.

A **tree** is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It is used to represent a hierarchical structure with a single root node and a set of child nodes. Tree representation techniques include:

- **Parent-Child Representation:** In this representation, each node has a reference to its parent node. For example, in a family tree, each child has a reference to its parent.

- **Child-Sibling Representation:** Each node has references to its children and its siblings (nodes with the same parent). This is commonly used in file systems where directories are nodes, and files are their children.

Example: Consider a family tree. Each person (node) is connected to their parents and siblings. In this tree, the topmost node represents the oldest generation (root), and child nodes represent younger generations.

### 3. What is a Graph Data Structure? Explain the graph representation techniques with a suitable example.

A **graph** is a collection of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes. It is used to represent various types of relationships. Graph representation techniques include:

- **Adjacency Matrix:** Using a matrix to represent the presence or absence of edges between vertices.

- **Adjacency List:** Maintaining a list of adjacent vertices for each vertex.

Example: Consider a social network. Each user is a node, and connections (friendships) between users are edges. You can use an adjacency list to represent this graph, where each user node stores a list of their friends.

### 4. List any five terminologies used in tree data structure with a suitable diagram.

Terminologies in tree data structure:

1. **Root:** The topmost node in the tree.
2. **Node:** Individual elements in the tree.
3. **Parent:** A node from which one or more nodes are directly descended.
4. **Child:** Nodes directly descended from another node.
5. **Leaf:** Nodes with no children.
6. **Siblings:** Nodes with the same parent.
7. **Depth:** The level of a node in the tree, with the root at depth 0.
8. **Height:** The maximum depth of the tree.

Diagram:
```
      A
     / \
    B   C
   /   / \
  D   E   F
```

- Root: A
- Nodes: A, B, C, D, E, F
- Parent: A (parent of B and C), B (parent of D), C (parent of E and F)
- Child: B (child of A), D (child of B), E (child of C), F (child of C)
- Leaf: D, E, F
- Siblings: B and C
- Depth: A (depth 0), B (depth 1), C (depth 1), D (depth 2), E (depth 2), F (depth 2)
- Height: 2

### 5. Compare and contrast adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations for graphs. Discuss their advantages and disadvantages.

| **Aspect**             | **Adjacency Matrix**                                      | **Adjacency List**                                |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Memory Usage**      | Consumes more memory, O(V^2) for V vertices in the graph. | Consumes less memory, O(V + E) for E edges.      |
| **Edge Presence**     | Efficient for dense graphs with many edges.             | Efficient for sparse graphs with few edges.      |
| **Adding/Removing Edges** | Adding/removing edges is slow.                        | Adding/removing edges is fast.                    |
| **Iterating over Neighbors** | Inefficient for iterating over neighbors.          | Efficient for iterating over neighbors.          |
| **Space Complexity**  | Space usage is constant per edge (O(1)).                 | Space usage per edge is O(1) plus storage for the linked lists. |
| **Advantages**        | Quick edge presence check.                               | Efficient memory usage for sparse graphs.       |
| **Disadvantages**      | Inefficient memory usage for sparse graphs.              | Slower edge presence check for sparse graphs.     |

### 6. Describe the concept of a Palindromic Tree and its application in string processing algorithms.

- A **Palindromic Tree** is a data structure used in string processing algorithms.
- Its purpose is to efficiently find and process all palindromic substrings in a given string.
- It is particularly useful in applications like text compression and pattern recognition.
- The Palindromic Tree stores information about palindromic substrings and their occurrences.
- It computes and maintains this information during string processing.
- This data structure aids in identifying and counting palindromic substrings within a text.
- It is valuable for applications like finding repeated patterns, recognizing palindromic sequences in DNA analysis, and text compression.
- The Palindromic Tree allows for the detection of palindromes in linear time complexity, making it valuable for tasks involving palindromic patterns.

### 7. Explain the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for graph traversal. Provide a step-by-step explanation.

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm used for graph traversal. It explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it visits all the neighbors of a vertex before moving on to their neighbors. Here's a step-by-step explanation of BFS:

1. Start at the initial vertex (source vertex).
2. Initialize a queue data structure to keep track of visited vertices.
3. Mark the source vertex as visited and enqueue it into the queue.
4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:
   - Dequeue a vertex from the front of the queue (let's call it the current vertex).
   - Visit and process the current vertex.
   - Enqueue all unvisited neighbors of the current vertex and mark them as visited.
5. Repeat step 4 until the queue is empty.
6. The algorithm visits all vertices reachable from the source vertex, ensuring that it explores nodes level by level.

BFS is widely used in applications like finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs, web crawling, and network broadcasting. It guarantees that the shortest path to all reachable vertices is found when the graph

- Space complexity refers to the amount of memory or storage space required by an algorithm to complete its task.
- It is usually measured in terms of auxiliary space (additional memory) used for data structures, variables, and recursion stacks.
- Space complexity helps analyze how efficiently an algorithm uses memory resources.

**Time Complexity:**

- It provides an estimation of how the algorithm's running time grows concerning the input.
- Common time complexity notations include O(n), O(log n), O(n^2), etc.

### 2. Define a minimum spanning tree with an example.

A **minimum spanning tree (MST)** is a subset of the edges of a connected, undirected graph that connects all the vertices with the minimum possible total edge weight. MSTs are often used in network design and optimization problems.

**Example:**
Consider a graph with vertices A, B, C, D, and E, and edge weights as follows:

- AB: 2
- AC: 3
- AD: 4
- BC: 1
- BD: 5
- CD: 6
- CE: 7

A minimum spanning tree for this graph would be:

- AB (Weight: 2)
- BC (Weight: 1)
- AC (Weight: 3)
- CD (Weight: 6)

The total weight of this minimum spanning tree is 2 + 1 + 3 + 6 = 12.

### 3. List two different types of minimum spanning trees.

Two different types of minimum spanning trees include:

1. **Prim's Algorithm MST:** Prim's algorithm starts with a single vertex and adds the minimum-weight edges to grow the MST until all vertices are included. It operates in a vertex-based manner.
2. **Kruskal's Algorithm MST:** Kruskal's algorithm begins with an empty set of edges and adds edges in ascending order of weight, ensuring that they do not create cycles in the MST. It operates in an edge-based manner.

### 4. List any two greedy methods approaches.

Two greedy method approaches include:

1. **Greedy Algorithm:** Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. Examples include Prim's algorithm for MST and Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths.
2. **Huffman Coding:** Huffman coding is a greedy algorithm used for lossless data compression. It creates variable-length codes for data by building a binary tree with the least frequent symbols at the top.

- The primary objective is to minimize the total distance or cost of the journey.
- TSP is crucial in logistics and route optimization.
- It's classified as NP-hard, which means it becomes computationally challenging for a large number of cities.

| **Notation**       | O(f(n)) for worst-case time complexity.    | Ω(f(n)) for best-case time complexity.  | Θ(f(n)) for both best and worst cases.    |
| **Example**        | O(n^2) for an algorithm with a worst-case time complexity of n^2. | Ω(n) for an algorithm with a best-case time complexity of n. | Θ(n) for an algorithm with the same best-case and worst-case time complexity of n. |

### 2. Explain the Knapsack problem with an example.

The **Knapsack problem** is a classic optimization problem where you are given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and you need to determine the best combination of items to include in a knapsack (a bag) with a limited weight capacity. The objective is to maximize the total value of the items in the knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity.

Example:
Suppose you have a knapsack with a weight capacity of 10 pounds and the following items:

Item 1: Weight = 2 pounds, Value = $6
Item 2: Weight = 4 pounds, Value = $10
Item 3: Weight = 7 pounds, Value = $15
Item 4: Weight = 5 pounds, Value = $7

You need to determine the combination of items to include in the knapsack to maximize the total value while not exceeding the weight capacity.

### 3. Explain the Traveling Salesman Problem with an example.

The **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** is a well-known optimization problem. In TSP, a salesman needs to visit a set of cities exactly once and return to the starting city, minimizing the total distance or cost traveled.

Example:
Consider a salesman who needs to visit four cities (A, B, C, D) with given distances between them:

- A to B: 10 miles
- A to C: 15 miles
- A to D: 20 miles
- B to C: 35 miles
- B to D: 25 miles
- C to D: 30 miles

The goal is to find the optimal order in which the cities should be visited to minimize the total distance traveled and return to the starting city.

### 4. Provide an example of a real-world problem where algorithm analysis plays a crucial role.

- **Route optimization for delivery services** presents a real-world problem.
- Companies like UPS, FedEx, and Amazon rely on efficient route planning to save time, reduce fuel costs, and ensure timely deliveries.
- Algorithm analysis is crucial for developing routing algorithms tailored to these needs.
- These algorithms consider various factors, including traffic conditions, delivery time windows, vehicle capacity, and stop order.
- Optimized routes play a key role in minimizing operational costs and enhancing customer satisfaction for these delivery services.

### 5. Explain the concept of dynamic programming. Provide an example problem and demonstrate how dynamic programming can be applied to solve it.

**Dynamic programming** is a problem-solving technique that involves breaking down a complex problem into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem only once. It stores the results of subproblems in a table to avoid redundant calculations. Dynamic programming is often used for optimization problems.

Example: The **Fibonacci sequence** is a classic example. To find the nth Fibonacci number, you can use dynamic programming (bottom-up approach) as follows:

1. Initialize an array to store Fibonacci numbers, `fib`, with the first two values set to 0 and 1.
2. For `i` from 2 to `n`:
   - Set `fib[i]` to `fib[i-1] + fib[i-2]`.
3. The value at `fib[n]` is the nth Fibonacci number.

Dynamic programming avoids redundant calculations, making it efficient for computing Fibonacci numbers and other recursive problems.

### 6. Explain the concept of the greedy method. Provide an example problem and demonstrate how the greedy method can be applied to solve it.

The **greedy method** is an algorithmic paradigm that makes locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. It is used for optimization problems.

Example: **Coin Change Problem**. Given a set of coin denominations (e.g., 1, 5, 10, 25 cents), find the minimum number of coins needed to make change for a given amount (

e.g., 63 cents).

The greedy approach is to always select the largest coin denomination that is less than or equal to the remaining amount. In the example, to make 63 cents, you would use two 25-cent coins and three 1-cent coins, for a total of five coins.

The greedy method is efficient and works well for the coin change problem, but it may not always find the global optimum for all problems.

### 7. Develop an algorithm for a minimum spanning tree.

One of the algorithms for finding a minimum spanning tree is **Kruskal's algorithm**:

1. Initialize an empty set to store the minimum spanning tree.
2. Sort all edges in the graph in ascending order of their weights.
3. Iterate through the sorted edges:
   - Add an edge to the minimum spanning tree if it doesn't form a cycle with the edges already in the tree.
   - Use a disjoint-set data structure to check for cycles.
4. Continue this process until the minimum spanning tree contains (V - 1) edges, where V is the number of vertices in the graph.
5. The set of edges in the minimum spanning tree is the solution.

Kruskal's algorithm efficiently finds a minimum spanning tree in a connected, weighted graph. It is widely used in network design, such as in constructing efficient road or communication networks.

### 3. Write an application of string matching algorithms.

- **Spell-checking** and **autocorrect** features in various software applications employ string matching algorithms.
- These algorithms identify and correct misspelled words by comparing the input text to a dictionary of correctly spelled words.
- For instance, if a user types a word like "teh" instead of "the," the string matching algorithm can detect the error.
- It searches for the closest matching word in the dictionary and suggests the correction to the user.
- This application is widely used in word processing software, email clients, and messaging apps to enhance the quality of written communication.

|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Comparison Approach**| Character-by-character comparisons                  | Utilizes a precomputed partial match table      |
| **Handling Mismatches**| Moves the pattern one position to the right on mismatch | Skips characters efficiently using the precomputed table |
| **Time Complexity**    | O(m * (n-m+1)), where "m" is pattern length and "n" is text length | O(n + m), which is more efficient                |

The main difference is in their time complexity and the approach used to handle mismatches. KMP is more efficient than the naive algorithm, especially for long texts and patterns.

### 6. Explain Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm.

- The **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm** is a string searching algorithm.
- It is used to find all occurrences of a pattern within a text.
- KMP is known for its linear time complexity, making it highly efficient for string searching.
- The algorithm employs a precomputed partial match table (also known as the "failure function" or "LPS" - Longest Prefix Suffix) to determine the number of characters to skip on a mismatch.
- This table helps reduce unnecessary character comparisons and ensures efficient alignment of the pattern with the text.
- KMP is particularly valuable when searching for patterns in long texts and finds extensive use in text processing, data mining, and information retrieval applications due to its efficient performance.

### 7. Explain Boyer-Moore algorithm.

- The **Boyer-Moore algorithm** is a string searching algorithm designed for efficient pattern search within longer text.
- It is preferred for text processing applications due to its practical speed.
- The algorithm matches characters from the end of the pattern to the beginning.
- When a mismatch occurs, it skips ahead multiple positions, reducing character comparisons.
- Boyer-Moore utilizes two key tables: a bad character table (for skipping characters on mismatch) and a good suffix table (to align with mismatched text).
- It is highly efficient in practice, especially for searching long texts with short patterns, making it valuable for applications like text searching and data processing.

## 5 Marks:
### 1. Elaborate the process of the string machine algorithm in brief.

The **string machine algorithm** is a computational technique used for efficient string matching. It involves scanning a text string to find occurrences of a specific pattern within it. The process typically includes the following steps:

1. **Preprocessing:** The pattern is preprocessed to generate data structures or tables that allow for efficient matching. Common techniques include building a suffix tree, a suffix array, or a finite automaton that represents the pattern.

2. **Matching:** The text string is scanned from left to right, and the pattern is compared against it character by character.

3. **Partial Matching:** When a mismatch is encountered, the algorithm uses the precomputed data structures to determine how many characters can be skipped before the next comparison. This minimizes the number of character comparisons, leading to faster matching.

4. **Result:** The algorithm reports the positions or indices in the text string where the pattern is found.

The string machine algorithm is used in various applications like text searching, data mining, and information retrieval.

### 2. Illustrate the naive algorithm in brief.

The **naive algorithm** is a simple and straightforward technique for string matching. It works as follows:

1. Start at the beginning of the text string and the beginning of the pattern.
2. Compare characters of the pattern with characters of the text from left to right.
3. If a mismatch is found, move one position to the right in the text string and restart the comparison with the pattern from the beginning.
4. Continue this process until a match is found or the end of the text string is reached.

The naive algorithm is simple to understand and implement, but it is not the most efficient string matching algorithm, especially for large texts and patterns. It has a time complexity of O(m * (n-m+1)), where "m" is the length of the pattern and "n" is the length of the text.

3. **Information Retrieval:** They are used to retrieve relevant information from databases and documents based on user queries.

4. **Pattern Recognition:** String matching algorithms are applied in pattern recognition tasks, such as identifying regular patterns in images or signals.

5. **Spelling Correction:** They are used in spell-checking and autocorrection applications to suggest correct spellings for misspelled words.

6. **Computer Security:** String matching is used in intrusion detection systems to identify known attack patterns or signatures in network traffic.

7. **Bioinformatics:** String matching is crucial for tasks like DNA sequence alignment, where identifying similar patterns in genetic sequences is essential.

8. **Web Content Analysis:** String machine algorithms are used in web scraping and content analysis to extract specific information from web pages.

### 4. List & explain in brief the types of string machine algorithm with proper examples.

There are various types of string machine algorithms, including:

1. **Naive Algorithm:** As explained earlier, it performs character-by-character comparisons between the pattern and text. Example: Searching for a substring in a document.

2. **Boyer-Moore Algorithm:** It uses two key tables (the bad character table and the good suffix table) to efficiently skip characters during the search. Example: Text searching in text editors and search engines.

3. **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm:** KMP uses a precomputed partial match table to avoid unnecessary character comparisons. Example: Searching for keywords in a document.

4. **Rabin-Karp Algorithm:** Rabin-Karp uses a rolling hash function to quickly identify potential matches. Example: Plagiarism detection and substring search.

5. **Aho-Corasick Algorithm:** Aho-Corasick is used for multiple string searching, allowing the simultaneous search for multiple patterns in a text. Example: Intrusion detection and keyword matching.

Each of these algorithms has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different string matching applications.

### 5. Elaborate in brief the difference between the Rabin-Karp algorithm & Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm.

**Rabin-Karp Algorithm:**
- Utilizes a rolling hash function to identify potential matches.
- Compares the hash value of the pattern with the hash values of substrings in the text.
- May produce false positives due to hash collisions.
- Efficient for searching multiple patterns in a single pass.
- Example: Plagiarism detection.

**Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm:**
- Uses a precomputed partial match table (LPS) to skip characters during the search.
- Ensures exact matches by comparing characters.
- Typically does not produce false positives.
- Efficient for single pattern searching.
- Example: Keyword search in documents.

The main difference is in their approach to searching. Rabin-Karp uses hashing for quick identification, while KMP relies on the LPS table to skip unnecessary character comparisons.

### 6. Illustrate in detail what is the Rabin-Karp algorithm with its applications.

The **Rabin-Karp Algorithm** is a string searching algorithm that uses a rolling hash function to efficiently find a pattern within a text. Here's a detailed explanation:

- **Rolling Hash Function:** Rabin-Karp uses a rolling hash function that allows the hash value of a substring to be quickly updated as the window slides over the text. This helps in identifying potential matches.

- **Sliding Window:** The algorithm maintains a fixed-size window over the text and calculates the hash value for the substring within the window.

- **Comparison:** It compares the hash value of the pattern with the hash value of the substring in the window. If the hash values match, a character-by-character comparison is performed to confirm the match.

Applications of the Rabin-Karp Algorithm:

1. **Plagiarism Detection:** Rabin-Karp is used to efficiently compare large documents for similarities and identify potential instances of plagiarism by matching text patterns.

2. **Substring Search:** It is employed in text editors and search engines to search for substrings or keywords within documents or web pages.

3. **File Comparison:** Rabin-Karp can be used to compare files efficiently by identifying common sections or differences in files.

4. **Data Deduplication:** In data storage and backup systems, Rabin-Karp is used to identify duplicate data chunks to save storage space.

The Rabin-Karp algorithm is versatile and suitable for applications that involve identifying similar patterns within text or data.

### 7. Reason behind why we use the Boyer-Moore algorithm, also explain it in brief words with examples.

The **Boyer-Moore Algorithm** is widely used for string searching because of its practical speed and efficiency. It's particularly valuable for searching long texts with short patterns. Here are the reasons behind its popularity:

1. **Character Comparison from the End:** Boyer-Moore matches characters from the end of the pattern to the beginning, which allows for faster detection of mismatches and efficient skipping of characters.

2. **Bad Character and Good Suffix Rules:** The algorithm uses two key tables, the bad character

 table and the good suffix table, to determine how far the pattern can be shifted in the event of a mismatch. This reduces the number of character comparisons.

3. **Efficient Preprocessing:** Boyer-Moore preprocesses the pattern to build the tables, which is a one-time cost. This preprocessing improves search speed when applied to multiple texts.

Example: Searching for the word "algorithm" within a large document. Boyer-Moore quickly identifies and reports all occurrences of the word by efficiently handling mismatches and character skipping.

Boyer-Moore is used in various text processing applications, including search engines, text editors, and data processing systems, where speed and efficiency are critical for handling large volumes of text data.
